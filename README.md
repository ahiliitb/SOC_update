We learned CSS, HTML, and javascript from a free code camp, We then made a project on Python just to learn it, my project was on web scraping, during the project I learn pandas dataframe, bs4, and requests module, and thus got very good knowledge on python, then we have learned docker from programming with mosh and codewithharry youtube channel. Then I learned about docker and learned how to deploy a project through docker and also learned to deploy a website. Then I made a portfolio website and also deploy it through Git Hub. And finally, we have started our final project where we are making the frontend part of the E-commerce website first and we will do the backend part.
